#template file for inputing modified nucleotides in Pytheas
#one modified nucleotides/position per line
#five fields separated with a space
#1) Molecule: fasta header of the RNA sequence until the first space 
#   (e.g. fasta header ">tRNA_Phe Human" will be "tRNA_Phe")
#2) Position: position to modify in the RNA sequence
#3) ID: one-letter code for the modified nucleotides, consistent with IDs 
#   used in the elemental composition input files (default is nts_light.xlsx)
#4) Id_ext: human-readable code for the modified nucleotides, consistent with ID_exts 
#   used in the elemental composition input files (default is nts_light.xlsx)
#5) Include: 1,2 or 3. Keep only the modified oligomer on this position [1], 
#   keep both modified and unmodified [2], keep only unmodified [0]
