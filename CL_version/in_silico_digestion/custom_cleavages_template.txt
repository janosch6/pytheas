# template file for specifying custom cleavage site/sites in the input RNA dequences
# insert one cleaving site per line
# The cleaved phosphodiester bond is highlighted with an asterisk (*)
# Nucleotide one letter code is supported: Y (C or U), R (A or G) and N (C,U,A or G)
# In the example below, RNA sequence will be cleaved (3' of G) AND (between C and A) AND (5' of CA or CG)
